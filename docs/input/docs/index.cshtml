Title: Documentation
---
<p>This user guide, like ReSharperReports itself, is under very active development. Some parts of it aren't 
documented as completely as they need to be, but we glady accept your contributions.</p>

<p>We need your help to improve the documentation for ReSharperReports, so if there is something that you 
would like to add then you can edit the content directly on GitHub.</p>

    if(child.ContainsKey(DocsKeys.Description))
    {
        <p>@Html.Raw(child.String(DocsKeys.Description))</p>
    }

    @Html.Partial("_ChildPages", child)
