## Example Usage

The following is an example of how to transform the report generated by DupFinder:

**NOTE:** ReSharperReports will auto-detect whether the provided report comes from DupFinder or InspectCode and use the correct default XSL Transformation file.

`ReSharperReports.exe transform -i "c:/temp/dupfinder-output.xml" -o "c:/temp/dupfinder-output.html"`

The following is an example of how to transform the report generated by InspectCode:

`ReSharperReports.exe transform -i "c:/temp/inspectcode-output.xml" -o "c:/temp/inspectcode-output.html"`

If you want to override the default XSL Transformation, and provide your own transformation file, you would use the following:

`ReSharperReports.exe transform -i "c:/temp/dupfinder-output.xml" -o "c:/temp/dupfinder-output.html -x "c:/temp/inspectcode.xsl"`

To pipe the generated log messages to a separate file, you would use the following:

`ReSharperReports.exe transform -i "c:/temp/dupfinder-output.xml" -o "c:/temp/dupfinder-output.html -l "c:/temp/resharperreports.log"`
